# saros: Semi-Automatic Reporting of Ordinary Surveys

Offers a systematic way for conditional reporting of figures and tables
for many (and bivariate combinations of) variables, typically from
survey data. Contains interactive 'ggiraph'-based
(<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggiraph>) plotting functions and
data frame-based summary tables (bivariate significance tests,
frequencies/proportions, unique open ended responses, etc) with many
arguments for customization, and extensions possible. Uses a global
options() system for neatly reducing redundant code. Also contains tools
for immediate saving of objects and returning a hashed link to the
object, useful for creating download links to high resolution images
upon rendering in 'Quarto'. Suitable for highly customized reports,
primarily intended for survey research.
