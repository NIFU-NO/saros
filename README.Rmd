## Introduction
{saros} (Semi-Automatic Reporting of Ordinary Surveys) is an R package designed to handle repeating surveys within the same project that occur annually or biannually. It aims to automate the process of summarizing and reporting on survey data, helping researchers save time and maintain consistency across survey iterations. Specifically, {saros} produces highly customizable figures, text, analyses and reports for a batch of possible dependent-independent relations of possible interest.


### Connection to the Astronomical concept of Saros
The term "saros" also refers to a cyclical phenomenon in astronomy known as the Saros cycle, which represents a period of approximately 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours. After one Saros cycle, the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to approximately the same relative positions, leading to a similar eclipse.

* Cyclical occurrences: In the case of this R package, cyclical events relates to surveys that are repeated annually or biannually, while in astronomy, cyclical events refers to the recurring pattern of eclipses.

* Consistency: The saros R package aims to maintain consistency in reporting and analysis across survey iterations, just as the astronomical Saros cycle represents a predictable pattern in the occurrence of solar and lunar eclipses.

* Time-saving: The saros R package is designed to automate and streamline the process of summarizing and reporting on survey data, saving researchers time and effort. Similarly, the Saros cycle is a useful tool for astronomers to predict and plan for future eclipses, making it easier to study these events without having to make complex calculations each time.



## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("sda030/saros")
```


## Draft a report
```{r example2}
# Define temporary folder for storing the elements
library(saros)
output_index_qmd <-
  draft_report(chapter_overview = ex_survey_ch_overview, 
             data = ex_survey, 
             mesos_var = "f_uni",
             path = tempdir()
             )
quarto::quarto_render(output_index_qmd, as_job = FALSE)
if(interactive()) {
  browseURL(output_index_qmd)
  browseURL(fs::path(tempdir(), "index.html"))
}
```

    

```{r example3}
library(saros)
output_index_qmd <-
  draft_report(chapter_overview = 
                 dplyr::mutate(ex_survey_ch_overview, 
                               indep = ifelse(.data$indep == "x1_sex",

               digits = 0,
               data_label_decimal_symbol = ",",
             path = tempdir())
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
system.time( # 519 sec
  for(file in output_index_qmd) {
    quarto::quarto_render(file, as_job = TRUE)
  }
  )
if(interactive()) {
  browseURL(fs::path(tempdir(), "Uni of C", "Uni of C_main_index.html"))
}
