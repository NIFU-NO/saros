# First-time setup: Install newest R, Rtools, Rstudio and saros
If using Windows:

- Make sure you have administrator privileges
- Open Windows menu, then write cmd and click <enter>
- `winget install RProject.R` and <enter>
- `winget install Rtools` and <enter>
- `winget install rstudio` and <enter>
- Ask your local R coordinator for any organizational site-wide setup

If using Mac or Linux, download the above from the respective websites.

Configure Rstudio according to preferences
- For writing longer texts, configuring appearance of Rstudio might be beneficial.


# Beginning with a pre-made report draft from Saros
- You will find a folder with a *.qmd-file, and an attached folder with same name.
- We recommend copying the file and folder to a working directory, to ensure that accidental re-production of the draft report will not overwrite your work!
- The qmd-file, a Quarto file, can be opened in any text editor, such as Notepad.
- However, things are much more fun when opening it in RStudio
    - It allows you to combine regular text and R-syntax (as well as a lot more)
    - You no longer need to store tables and figures from your statistical software, then copy these into Word.
    - It makes it very easy to create interactive HTML-pages (websites), PDFs, Word-documents, etc.

# Editing mode Quarto
- You have two options for working in a Quarto document: Source or Visual. 
    - Visual: More aesthetically pleasing, easy to hide code, formatting more similar to final output.
    - Source: You see everything, good for sorting out weirdness. Slightly faster with longer documents.
- Tip: If using Visual mode, collapse all chunks, YAML header at the top, and output that you are not currently working on. It will increase your focus and speed up things greatly.
- Tip: Show output for a specific chunk by clicking little green triangle on the right side of the chunk. 

# How to format text
- Use what suits you best, keyboard letters, keyboard shortcuts, or the Format menu.
- Formatting more or less follows Markdown.

# Understanding a chunk of code
- You do not need to know R well to understand Quarto and Saros
![](figures/chunk_dissection.png)
- A pre-made saros chunk typically consists of 
    - label: Do not touch this as it serves as the ID for the figure/table that you can reference in the text.
    - fig-cap: Feel free to edit the caption as you like.
    - fig-width/fig-height: Feel free to edit but usually not necessary.
    - the actual R code: 
        - reads in pre-made table (as a data frame) or a graph (as ggplot2 object)
