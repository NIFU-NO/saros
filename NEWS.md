# saros 1.6.0
-   Sorting: Independent-variable ordering is now computed per dependent variable, allowing indep order to vary per dep; descend_indep now consistently reverses indep order across tables and plots; plots use centralized .indep_order when indep is on the x-axis; ordered indep factors take precedence over sort_indep_by (reversed only when descend_indep=TRUE); legends preserve unused response levels in .category
-   Using `air` for consistent code formatting
-   Feature: makeme() has new output type = "int_plot_html" for interactive interval plots with violin and box plots
-   Feature: Added support for `data_label = "mean"` and `data_label = "median"` in `makeme()` for `type = "cat_*_html"` outputs (addresses issue #460)
-   Feature: Added `data_label_position` argument to `makeme()` allowing data labels to be positioned at "center", "bottom", "top", or "above" bars in categorical plots (addresses issue #365)
-   Feature: Added `.onUnload()` function to clean up global options when package is unloaded, preventing option pollution in user's R session
-   Feature: Enhanced `chr_table_html` to support multiple independent variables for displaying background context with open-ended text responses. Now allows researchers to show demographic or other contextual information alongside character survey responses
-   Refactor: Modularized tabular I/O functionality - renamed `pretty_tabular.R` to `tabular_write.R` and extracted `tabular_read()` function into separate file. 
-   Refactor: Split `post_process_makeme_data()` into focused single-responsibility functions: `process_indep_factor_levels()` for general factor reversal and `process_binary_category_colors()` for cat_plot_html-specific binary category processing. Improves architectural clarity and maintainability
-   Major change: `makeme()` returns an empty data.frame instead of `NULL` if not plot or table can be created, simplifying downstream code (e.g. `gt::gt()` fails if served `NULL`).
-   Major change: Resolved issue #372 - `descend` parameter now works correctly with ordered factors while preserving their inherent level ordering. Ordered factors maintain their natural order as the base, but `descend` can reverse the display order
-   Refactor: Substantially modularized internal implementation of `makeme()` into focused helper functions (argument setup, crowd processing, output assembly, validation). Improves readability, testability (+ new helper tests), and robustness without changing public API (closes #368)
-   Enhancement: Completely rewrote the `.spread` algorithm in `subset_vector()` for better spread maximization using evenly spaced positions
-   Updated documentation reference from `ggplot2::theme_set()` to `ggplot2::set_theme()` due to ggplot 4.0.0.
-   Fix: **CRITICAL** - Resolved bug in `makeme()` where combinations of valid factor variables with all-NA factor variables incorrectly threw "mix of categorical and continuous variables" error. Variable type checking now uses filtered variable lists instead of original lists, preventing premature type validation errors
-   Fix: Resolved faceting issue in `int_plot_html` where `label_separator = NULL` with independent variables caused violin/boxplot and label geoms to appear in separate facets due to inconsistent string wrapping between main plot data and descriptive statistics
-   Fix: Removed unnecessary "multiple main questions" warning when using `label_separator = NULL`, as having different main questions is expected behavior in this context
-   Fix: Corrected double NA check logic in `check_bool()` function - removed redundant condition that made validation always pass for NA values
-   Fix: Improved NULL and NA handling in `glue_together_range()` to prevent edge case failures with empty or invalid data ranges
-   Fix: Resolved issue #464 - `makeme()` failures for sigtest_table when dep and indep variables overlap. Now automatically excludes indep variables from dep selection to prevent conflicts
-   Fix: Improved robustness of `check_no_duplicated_label_suffix()` to handle empty data frames and missing columns gracefully
-   Fix: Enhanced `check_sort_by()` validation to properly handle empty character vectors with clear error messages
-   Fix: Improved `keep_subitem()` to handle character inputs and use factor levels for better NA handling
-   Fix: Simplified `arrange_table_data()` sorting logic for better reliability
-   Enhancement: **PERFORMANCE** - Optimized `makeme()` examples for 73.8% faster execution (6.6s â†’ 1.7s total). Reduced variable counts and crowd configurations while maintaining educational value. Examples now run efficiently for R package documentation and CRAN checks
-   Enhancement: Updated `fig_height_h_barchart2()` example for consistency with optimized examples
-   Dev: Added comprehensive test coverage for `makeme()` helper functions with full roxygen2 documentation and @keywords internal annotation for internal API clarity
-   Dev: Added comprehensive visual regression testing for `int_plot_html` using vdiffr snapshot tests covering various scenarios including multiple variables, independent variables, inverse layouts, and error handling
-   Dev: Added comprehensive test coverage for utility validation functions
-   Dev: Added comprehensive unit tests for `makeme()` variable type checking edge cases including all-NA variables, multiple scenarios, and disabled filtering
-   Dev: Added VS Code configuration for improved development experience
-   Dev: Added `survey` package to Suggests for enhanced testing capabilities
-   Dev: Updated build ignore patterns for coverage reports and library files

# saros 1.5.4
-   Fix: Corrected error introduced in 1.5.3

# saros 1.5.3
-   Fix: `makeme` now handles arguments in parent frame scopes correctly.
-   Fix: internal function `get_common_levels` now works with no provided `col_pos`.

# saros 1.5.1
-   Feature: Added `".percentage"` as valid (sorting) column
-   Feature: `cat_table_html` returns NULL if nothing to display
-   Fix: `scale_x_reordered` now only sorts when needed
-   Fix: `cat_table_html` takes showNA properly
-   Minor: refactoring of `cat_plot_html`

# saros 1.5.0

## Major changes
- Lots of settings for `makeme()` useful for creating plots comparing a group with all other groups combined, or everyone. 
- `fig_height_h_barchart()` finally works adequately for 90 percent of figure combinations.
- Global settings inheritance for `makeme()`, `make_link()`, `girafe()`, `n_range()`, `n_range2()`
- New function `makeme(type="int_plot_html")` for violin plots

## Minor changes
- `makeme(type="cat_plot_html")` no longer shows a line one the y axis for single variable plots.
- Refactored `crosstable.data.frame()` and `crosstable.survey()` methods.
- Many more tests.
- Countless bugfixes.

# saros 1.2.0

## Major changes
- `embed_*`-functions are replaced by `makeme(type="cat_plot")` etc
    - `makeme()` takes S3-methods which eases expansions.
    - `embed_*` are thus lifecycle soft-deprecated.

## New features
- `n_range()` gives the n_range for a given dataset, dependent and independent variables.
- `n_range2()` same as `n_range()` but takes a `makeme()`-object for convenience.
- `make_link()` for generating downloadable figures, tables, data or anything else, on the spot.
- `ggsaver()` is a minor wrapper to ease using make_link with ggplot2::ggsave().
- `fig_height_h_barchart()` estimates the optimal figure height for a horizontal barchart.
- `fig_height_h_barchart2()` same as above, but takes a makeme()-object for convenience.
- `makeme(type="cat_plot_html")` allows sorting within each dependent variable-by-independent variable (facet-sort)

## Bugfixes
- Too many to list, but see saros 1.1.0 for some of them.
