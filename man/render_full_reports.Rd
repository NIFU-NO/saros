\description{
If one wishes to render complete reports that are linked to
in a website, but not listed among the chapters on the sidebar menu,
one can make these with filenames starting with underscores (_) which
will make them not listed in said menu. However, this will also mean they
are not rendered in a Quarto (Website) project. This function, which can
be called within a post-script (see example below), will render only these
after the ordinary rendering of the project, and copied to the _site folder.
