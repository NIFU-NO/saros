\usage{
setup_access_restrictions(
  remote_basepath = "/home/",
  local_basepath = "_site",
  rel_path_base_to_parent_of_user_restricted_folder = file.path("Reports", "2022",
    "Mesos"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{remote_basepath}{String. Folder where site will be located if using FTP-server. Needed for .htaccess-files.}

\item{local_basepath}{String. Local folder for website, typically "_site".}

\item{rel_path_base_to_parent_of_user_restricted_folder}{String, relative path from basepath to the folder where the restricted folders are located. (E.g. the "mesos"-folder)}

\item{local_main_password_path}{String. Path to main file containing all usernames and passwords formatted with a colon between username and password.}

\item{universal_usernames}{Character vector. Usernames in local_main_htpasswd_path which always have access to folder}

\item{log_rounds}{Integer, number of rounds in the bcrypt algorithm. The higher the more time consuming and harder to brute-force.}

\item{append_users}{Boolean, if TRUE (default) will create new users and add them to local_main_password_path. See also password_input.}

\item{password_input}{String, either "prompt" which asks the user for input. Alternatively, a number stored as string for a generated random password of said length: "8", "10", "12", "16"}

\item{type}{Character vector. "netlify" will create _headers file used for Netlify. "apache" will create .htaccess and .htpasswd files used for general FTP-servers.}
