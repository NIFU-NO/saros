\arguments{
\item{remote_basepath}{String. FTP servers often have a subdomain path location different from "/home/". Adjust this here.}

\item{site}{String. Path to where to copy folders and files to setup what Quarto needs to build a project.}

\item{rel_path_base_to_parent_of_user_restricted_folder}{String. Path going from basepath to the folder containg folders to password-protect.}

\item{overwrite}{Flag. Defaults to FALSE to ensure you know what you are doing. If TRUE, will delete all files and folders in site!}

\item{prompt}{Flag. Whether to ask the user if they are certain. Defaults to TRUE.}

\description{
Rendering a website on a Sharepoint/OneDrive location can be a pain
due to long filepaths above 260 characters, which causes read errors. This
function simplifies things by copying a site from local_basepath to a site_basepath,
sets up basic access authentication files (either Netlify's _headers file or
regular Apache .htaccess/.htpasswd files), as well as optionally copying
in an existing Netlify _publish.yaml-file.
