\usage{
process_global_indep_categories(
  kept_indep_cats_list,
  hide_for_all_crowds_if_hidden_for_crowd
)
}
\arguments{
\item{kept_indep_cats_list}{Named list of kept independent categories for each crowd}

\item{hide_for_all_crowds_if_hidden_for_crowd}{Character vector of crowd identifiers
that determine global category exclusions}
}
\value{
Modified kept_indep_cats_list with global hiding logic applied:

that were kept in the priority crowds are retained
