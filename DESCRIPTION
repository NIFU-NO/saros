Description: Produces highly customizable reports, primarily intended for survey research. 
    Building on 'Quarto' (<https://quarto.org>), it generates draft chapters of all specified dependent/independent variables, 
    which can be further edited by hand, containing figures, tables and analyses 
    (currently only uni-/bivariate tests of equivalent means/proportions). 
    The feature 'mesos'-reports offer tailor-made batch report production where e.g. an institution can compare 
    itself to all other participants. Publication tools are also included, 
    such as password generation for 'mesos'-report sections on a 'Quarto' Website.
