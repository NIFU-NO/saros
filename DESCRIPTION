Description: Produces highly customized reports, primarily intended for survey
    research. Building on 'Quarto' (<https://quarto.org>), it generates draft
    chapters of all specified dependent/independent variables, which can be
    further edited by hand, containing figures, tables and analyses (currently
    only uni-/bivariate tests of equivalent means/proportions). The feature
    'mesos'-reports offer tailor-made batch report production where e.g. an
    institution can compare itself to all other participants. Publication tools
    are also included, such as password generation for 'mesos'-report sections
    on a 'Quarto' Website.
