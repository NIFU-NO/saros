Description: Offers a systematic way for conditional reporting of figures and tables for many
    (and bivariate combinations of) variables, typically from survey data.
    Contains interactive 'ggiraph'-based 
    (<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggiraph>) plotting functions and
    data frame-based summary tables (bivariate significance tests, 
    frequencies/proportions, unique open ended responses, etc) with
    many arguments for customization, and extensions possible. Uses a global 
    options() system for neatly reducing redundant code.
    Also contains tools for immediate saving of objects and returning a hashed link to the object,
    useful for creating download links to high resolution images upon rendering in 'Quarto'. 
    Suitable for highly customized reports, primarily intended for survey
    research.
