Cross-cutting behaviors preserve: - Ordered indep factors take precedence sort_indep_by documented (.factor_order path). - descend/descend_indep change order direction; change chosen metric. - NA handling: exclude NAs metric computations unless metric explicitly NA share; still show row/column per showNA setting. - Ties: break using (1) .variable_position deps, factor-level indep applicable, else lexical label, name — document order. — ) .count_per_indep_group (Open) Definition: indep category (row), compute total count across selected deps (across dataset dep length 1) order indep total. Design options: - A1. Use existing aggregate .count_total_indep present; otherwise compute per-indep group total within indep-ordering stage. - A2. Scope total: - A2a. Sum across dep variables included call (cat_table_html path): ensures row-stable ordering regardless dep section displayed. - A2b. Sum within dep independently: vary dep compatible unified row order; reject tables multiple deps. Recommendation: A1 + A2a. Ensure single per-indep total (row-wise) available wherever indep ordering executes. Name: .count_total_indep. available, compute add_indep_order prerequisites. Edge cases: - indep = NULL: mode ignored, error. - dep single dep: still compute totals across single dep’s rows; order well-defined. - NA relevant cells: treat NA zero totals; document. - Ties: break indep factor order, label, name. Tests add: - Single dep vs multiple deps produce indep order using .count_per_indep_group. - descend_indep reverses indep order based totals. - Ties across two indep categories fall back factor level order. — B) Custom sorting columns (Implement B1 now; keep room B2 later) Definition: Allow sort_dep_by/sort_indep_by reference arbitrary computed columns (present pre-render data). Design options: - B1. Whitelist: allow documented set safe columns (e.g., .count, .proportion, .sum_value, .mean, .median, .count_total_indep, etc.). - B2. Open reference: accept column name string; validate existence numeric/ordering compatibility. Recommendation: Implement B1 now (whitelist), schema differs path (table vs plot) arbitrary columns missing. Keep room support B2 later hood (UX exposure yet) validation schema guarantees stronger. Validation: - validate_sort_column(data, column_name) fail fast missing. - non-numeric columns, use lexical ordering warning unless explicitly allowed (e.g., .variable_label). Tests add: - Attempt sorting missing column -> cli error helpful message. - Sorting non-numeric column outside allowed set -> warning error per policy. — C) Statistical measures (variance, std dev, range) (Open) Definition: Compute variability metrics across categories across indep groups rank deps (typical use) indep (less typical). Design options: - C1. Per-dep variability across categories (e.g., range category proportions), order deps metric. - C2. Per-dep variability across indep groups target category combined categories. Recommendation: Start C1 require indep interpretable cat_table_html; explicitly define measure computed (range default; optionally std dev later). Details: - Specify categories included (non-NA) whether ’re weighted counts. Initial version: unweighted, proportions. - desc behavior: higher variability first descend = TRUE.
