# AI Git Workflow Instructions

## Command: "git"

When the user says "git", execute this complete workflow:

### 1. Check for Changes
- Run `git status` and `git diff` to identify all uncommitted changes
- Analyze the types of changes (bug fixes, features, refactoring, documentation, linting)

### 2. Branch Strategy
- Create appropriate branches based on change types:
  - Single `dev` branch if changes are cohesive/related
  - Multiple feature branches if changes are distinct:
    - `feature/bug-fixes` - for bug fixes
    - `feature/new-features` - for new functionality
    - `refactor/code-cleanup` - for refactoring/cleanup
    - `docs/updates` - for documentation changes
    - `style/formatting` - for linting/formatting (always last)

### 3. Update Documentation
- Check if changes need to be documented in `NEWS.md`
- Add appropriate changelog entries if missing
- Use the current version from `DESCRIPTION` file

### 4. Commit Strategy
- Create separate commits for each logical group of changes
- Use conventional commit format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `refactor:` for code improvements
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `style:` for formatting/linting
  - `dev:` for development setup
- Commit linting/formatting changes LAST within each branch

### 5. Push and Create PRs
- Push all branches to remote
- Create GitHub Pull Requests using `gh pr create` with:
  - Descriptive titles based on changes
  - Detailed descriptions
  - Appropriate labels
  - Link branches back to main

### 6. Workflow Completion
- Provide summary of all branches and PRs created
- Show next steps for the user
